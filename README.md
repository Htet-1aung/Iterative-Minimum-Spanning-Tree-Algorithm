# Iterative-Minimum-Spanning-Tree-Algorithm


The Iterative Minimum Spanning Tree (IMST) algorithm is a variation of Prim's Algorithm that incorporates Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) methods. It aims to provide a more efficient and effective approach for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in certain graph structures compared to traditional Prim's Algorithm.

This algorithm is currently in research for more precise and proper results.This is conducted by Htet Aung(Sophomore Bsc.Computer Science Student)



## What is IMST Algorithm?

Iterative Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm is an algorithm uses greedy approach  to find MST such as Prim's Algorithm and Kruskal Algorithm.  As a derivative of Prim's Algorithm and use the BFS and DFS methods  in order to perform finding suitable vertices , compare them iteratively.
