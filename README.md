# Iterative-Minimum-Spanning-Tree-Algorithm




The Iterative Minimum Spanning Tree (IMST) algorithm is a variation of Prim's Algorithm that incorporates Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) methods. It aims to provide a more efficient and effective approach for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in certain graph structures compared to traditional Prim's Algorithm.

This algorithm is currently in research for more precise and proper results.This is conducted by Htet Aung(Sophomore Bsc.Computer Science Student)



## What is IMST Algorithm?

Iterative Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm is an algorithm uses greedy approach  to find MST such as Prim's Algorithm and Kruskal Algorithm.As a derivative of Prim's Algorithm and use the BFS and DFS methods  in order to perform finding suitable vertices , compare them iteratively.


## Features

- Efficiency: The IMST algorithm reduces unnecessary comparisons and enables faster execution times for large or complex graphs.
- Effective Vertex Selection: By utilizing BFS and DFS methods, the IMST algorithm identifies suitable vertices for MST construction more effectively, resulting in more optimal MSTs.
- Adaptability to Graph Structures: The IMST algorithm handles challenging graph scenarios such as disconnected components or dense clusters more effectively.
