**README.md for BFS-based MST Algorithm**

**Overview**

The BFS-based IMST algorithm is a graph algorithm that finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph. The MST is a subset of the edges of the graph that connects all the vertices of the graph with the minimum total weight.

**Algorithm**

The BFS-based IMST algorithm works as follows:

1. Start from a source vertex and initialize a priority queue with all the edges connected to the source vertex.
2. While the priority queue is not empty:
    * Dequeue the edge with the lowest weight from the priority queue.
    * If the destination vertex of the edge is not visited, mark it as visited and add the edge to the MST.
    * Add all the edges connected to the destination vertex to the priority queue.
3. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all vertices are visited.

**Drawbacks**

* The BFS-based MST algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(E log V), which is slightly worse than Prim's algorithm, which has a worst-case time complexity of O(E log E).
* The BFS-based MST algorithm requires more space than Prim's algorithm, as it needs to store the priority queue.

**Advantages**

* The BFS-based IMST algorithm is typically faster than Prim's algorithm for sparse graphs (graphs with a small number of edges compared to the number of vertices).
* The BFS-based IMST algorithm is easier to implement than Prim's algorithm.

**Time Complexity**

The time complexity of the BFS-based IMST algorithm is O(E log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices in the graph.

**Space Complexity**

The space complexity of the BFS-based IMST algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

**Applications**

The BFS-based IMST algorithm is used in a variety of applications, including:

* Network routing
* Minimum cost spanning trees
* Clustering
* Image segmentation

**Conclusion**

The BFS-based MST algorithm is a simple and efficient algorithm for finding the MST of a graph. It is particularly useful for sparse graphs, as it has a better time complexity than other MST algorithms such as Kruskal's algorithm.
