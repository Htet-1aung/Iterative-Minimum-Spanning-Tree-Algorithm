# Iterative-Minimum-Spanning-Tree-Algorithm


The Iterative Minimum Spanning Tree (IMST) algorithm is a variation of Prim's Algorithm that incorporates Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) methods. It aims to provide a more efficient and effective approach for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in certain graph structures compared to traditional Prim's Algorithm.

## Features

- Efficiency: The IMST algorithm reduces unnecessary comparisons and enables faster execution times for large or complex graphs.
- Effective Vertex Selection: By utilizing BFS and DFS methods, the IMST algorithm identifies suitable vertices for MST construction more effectively, resulting in more optimal MSTs.
- Adaptability to Graph Structures: The IMST algorithm handles challenging graph scenarios such as disconnected components or dense clusters more effectively.
